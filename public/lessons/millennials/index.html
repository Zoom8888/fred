        <p>The silent generation, baby boomers, Millennial, Generation X, Y or Z?</p>
<p>Nowadays every generation has a defining label, and a set of stereotypical attributes attached. There&rsquo;s often quite a lot of confusion regarding which generational classification everyone technically falls into.</p>
<p>People who are part of the silent generation are characterised as having been born from the mid-to-late 1920s until the early-to-mid 1940s.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;baby boomers&rdquo; refers to the drastic rise in birth rates that was noted following the end of World War II.</p>
<p>Generation X (or Gen X) is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers and preceding the Millennials. Popular media typically use birth years around 1965 to 1980 to define Generation Xers.</p>
<p>Millennials are often arguably regarded as an “entitled” generation that’s “ruined” everything, from diamonds to sex. Millennials can give as good as they get, sometimes expressing their disappointment in the way in which previous generations have handled issues such as the housing crisis. The more technical term for millennials is generation Y, as they succeed generation X and precede generation Z. The starting birth years for millennials are 1980 or 1981.</p>
<p>Generation Z are regarded as being a very tech-savvy generation, having been born during a time of fast-paced digital growth. They&rsquo;ve also received a lot of attention in the media recently due to their strong views regarding politics and current affairs, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>While many may flippantly describe all young people as millennials, the term is actually understood to refer to people who were born in the time period ranging from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s and early 2000s. However, as with generation Z, the exact start date for millennial birth years is a topic of debate.</p>
<p>Similar to generation Z, millennials are defined as being particularly adept at using technology and social media platforms. They often receive a tough time in the press, with members of the generation being accused of &ldquo;killing&rdquo; a variety of things, such as beer, motorcycles and the notion of owning a home. Millennials may become outnumbered by generation Z in the near future.</p>
