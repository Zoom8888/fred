        <h2>The modal auxiliary would.</h2>
    </header>
        <p>The modal auxiliary would (negative would not, which is often contracted to wouldn&rsquo;t) has several uses. One of them is in making a kind of &lsquo;artificial past&rsquo; for will in indirect (reported) speech. Another is in making polite requests.</p>
<p>Would is also commonly used in the expression would like. This expression (which is often contracted to &rsquo;d like with<br>
pronouns) does not mean &lsquo;like.&rsquo; Instead, it means want<br>
(though it is &lsquo;softer,&rsquo; less direct, and much more polite).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>I want more coffee. (very direct)<br>
Do you want to come with us? (very direct)<br>
Mr. Jones wants to say something. (very direct)</p>
<p>Sentences with Would Like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like some more coffee. (less direct, more polite)<br>
Would you like to come with us? (less direct, more polite)<br>
Mr. Jones would like to say something. (less direct, more polite)</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When would like is contracted to &rsquo;d like (I&rsquo;d like, you&rsquo;d like, she&rsquo;d like, etc.), the contraction for would is very difficult to hear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In very casual speech, the end of would often combines with the beginning of you to make a new sound. As a result, Would you sounds<br>
something like &lsquo;Wouldja&rsquo;:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wouldja like some coffee? (Would you like some coffee?)<br>
Wouldja like to dance? (Would you like to dance?)<br>
Wouldja like something to eat? ( Would you like something to eat?)</p>
<p>Wouldja is a spoken form, not a standard written form. In writing, it is not acceptable.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In very casual speech, both would and you are sometimes omitted entirely in questions:</li>
</ol>
<p>Like some coffee? (Would you like some coffee?)<br>
Like to dance? (Would you like to dance?)<br>
Like something to eat? (Would you like something to eat?)</p>
