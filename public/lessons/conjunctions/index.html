        <h2>Conjunctions - as, because, because of.</h2>
    </header>
        <p>As and because are conjunctions. As and because introduce subordinate clauses. They connect the result of something with its reason. Because is more common than as.</p>
<p>He spoke quietly because he did not want Susan to hear.<br>
Everyone left early because Robert and Susan had to catch an early flight in the morning.<br>
We&rsquo;ll come over on Saturday because Tom has to work on Friday.<br>
Are you feeling ill because you ate too much?</p>
<p>We often put the because-clause at the beginning of a sentence. We use a comma after the because-clause:</p>
<p>Because walking is something we do every day, we rarely think about it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because of&rsquo; is a two-word preposition meaning &lsquo;as a result of&rsquo;:</p>
<p>Because of the rain, the cricket match was postponed.<br>
There were so many people in the store because of the summer sale.</p>
<p>We often use as when we want to focus more on the result than the reason. As is more formal than because.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;ve decided to come as I wanted to hear about their Africa trip.<br>
As you all know each other, there&rsquo;s no need for introductions. We&rsquo;ll get straight down to business.</p>
<p>While and The Subordinate Clause</p>
<p>The subordinating conjunctions are:</p>
<p>after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, if, if only, rather than, since, that, though, unless, until, when, where, whereas, wherever, whether, which, and while.</p>
<p>The word; while; creates a subordinating conjunction when it begins a sentence. The key is that it instantly makes the clause dependent whether it is independent or dependent, so you will have to follow it with an independent clause.
When you attach a subordinate clause in front of a main clause, use a comma, like this:</p>
<p>Subordinate Clause, Main Clause.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>While Mary slept on the sofa in front of the television, Rover the family dog, gnawed on the leg of the coffee table.<br>
While the snow just kept coming down, it was not accumulating as quickly as you would think.<br>
While I did my homework, my father was washing the car.<br>
While my parents drank coffee, my brother was watching TV.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While&rsquo; is the subordinate conjunction that introduces the subordinate clause, and because it appears at the beginning of the complete sentence, it is separated from the main clause with a comma.</p>
