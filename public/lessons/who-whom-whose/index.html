        <h2>Who-whom-whose</h2>
    </header>
        <p>To know whether to use &lsquo;who&rsquo; or &lsquo;whom&rsquo;, we need to understand the difference between subjects and objects because you use &lsquo;who&rsquo; when you are referring to the subject of a clause and &lsquo;whom&rsquo; when you are referring to the object of a clause.</p>
<p>The subject of the sentence is the person doing something, and the object of the sentence is person having something done to them. If I kiss Mary, then I am the subject and Mary is the object.</p>
<p>who = subject</p>
<p>whom = object</p>
<p>who = he/she</p>
<p>whom = him/her</p>
<p>Whose is a possessive pronoun. Use it when you&rsquo;re asking (or telling) whom something belongs to.</p>
<p>For whom are you making that cake?<br>
I am making this cake for him (or her).</p>
<p>George was the student whom the teacher liked best.<br>
The teacher liked him best.</p>
<p>Who is going with you to the party?<br>
He (she) is going with me with to the party.</p>
<p>Do you know who is coming to see us?<br>
He is coming to see us.</p>
<p>Who wrote this article?<br>
Whom are you going to recommend?<br>
Whose book is on the table?<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t look like this is the right address. Whom did you ask for directions?<br>
We have two extra tickets for the show. Who wants to go with us?<br>
It wasn&rsquo;t me! I have no idea who left the stove on.<br>
Whose car is parked in the reserved parking space? If someone doesn&rsquo;t move it, it&rsquo;s going to be towed.<br>
The police have called in an expert to identify whose handwriting is actually on the ransom letter.<br>
Do you remember who received the award for best actor that year? Was it Tom Cruise?<br>
John couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of the student whose history project received the first prize.<br>
I know exactly whom I&rsquo;m going to support in the next election.<br>
That&rsquo;s the doctor who spent 15 years living in the Amazon basin.<br>
He&rsquo;s the actor whom she so vividly describes in her new book.<br>
Can you please tell me the names of the people who helped organise the picnic?</p>
<p>The form &lsquo;whom&rsquo; is becoming less and less common in English. Many native English speakers think &lsquo;whom&rsquo; sounds outdated or strange. This trend is particularly common in the American English. Especially when combined with prepositions, most people prefer to use &lsquo;who&rsquo; as the object pronoun. I think it&rsquo;s a valid word that we just need to learn how to use properly.</p>
